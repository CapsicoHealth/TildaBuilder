I'd like to create a simple ER diagram in my web application using open source libraries only. I have looked at D3 and JoinJS but that seemed complicated.

There are several options for creating an ER diagram in a web application using open source libraries:

    js-sequence-diagrams: This is a simple library that allows you to create sequence diagrams using a simple text syntax. It's easy to use and has a variety of customization options.

    mermaid: This is another library that allows you to create diagrams using a simple text syntax. It supports a variety of diagram types, including flowcharts, gantt charts, and ER diagrams.

    JointJS: This is a powerful diagramming library that allows you to create a variety of diagrams, including ER diagrams. It has a lot of customization options and is suitable for more complex diagrams.

    GoJS: This is another powerful diagramming library that is particularly well-suited for creating interactive diagrams. It has a lot of features and customization options, and is suitable for more complex diagrams.

    Cytoscape.js: This is a graph theory library that allows you to create and manipulate graphs and networks. It has a variety of layout options and is suitable for creating ER diagrams and other types of diagrams.

Ultimately, the best option for you will depend on your specific needs and preferences. I recommend trying out a few different libraries and seeing which one works best for you.

Are there other factors to consider regarding GoJS or JointJS? For example, size of the community, open source license, how active the projects are?

There are a few other factors that you may want to consider when choosing between GoJS and JointJS:

    Size of the community: Both JointJS and GoJS have active communities of users and developers, but GoJS has a larger user base. This can be beneficial if you need support or have questions about using the library.

    Open source license: Both JointJS and GoJS are available under open source licenses. JointJS is available under the MIT license, while GoJS is available under a proprietary license that allows for free use in non-commercial applications.

    Project activity: Both JointJS and GoJS are actively maintained and have frequent updates. However, GoJS has a larger development team and may have more resources dedicated to maintaining and improving the library.

    Ease of use: Both JointJS and GoJS have a steep learning curve and may require a significant investment of time and effort to master. However, GoJS has more comprehensive documentation and a larger user base, which may make it easier to get started with.

Ultimately, the best option for you will depend on your specific needs and preferences. I recommend evaluating each library based on the factors that are most important to you and choosing the one that best meets your needs.

The fact that GoJS uses a proprietary license for non-commercial use bothers me. I may wish to commercialize my application in the future.

It's understandable that the proprietary license of GoJS may be a concern if you are planning on commercializing your application in the future. In that case, you may want to consider using a different library that is available under a more permissive open source license.

JointJS is one alternative that is available under the MIT license, which allows for free use, modification, and distribution of the software, even in commercial applications. Another option is CytoscapeJS, which is available under the Apache 2.0 license, which also allows for free use, modification, and distribution of the software in commercial applications.

There are also other open source libraries available for creating diagrams, such as js-sequence-diagrams and mermaid, which may be suitable for your needs. Ultimately, the best option for you will depend on your specific requirements and preferences. I recommend evaluating the available options and choosing the one that best meets your needs.

You mentioned that JointJS has a steep learning curve. Can you show me a simple example of how to could start cfreating an ER diagram editor with it?

Certainly! Here is a simple example of how you can use JointJS to create an ER diagram editor:

    First, you will need to include the JointJS library in your project. You can either download the library from the JointJS website and include it in your project manually, or you can install it using a package manager such as npm or yarn.

    Next, you will need to create a container element in your HTML where the diagram will be rendered. This could be a div element with a specific ID that you can reference in your JavaScript code.

<div id="diagram-container"></div>

    In your JavaScript code, you can then create a new JointJS diagram and attach it to the container element.

var graph = new joint.dia.Graph();

var paper = new joint.dia.Paper({
    el: $('#diagram-container'),
    width: 500,
    height: 300,
    gridSize: 1,
    model: graph
});

    To create an ER diagram, you will need to create custom shapes for the entities and relationships in the diagram. You can do this using JointJS's joint.shapes.devs namespace, which provides a set of basic shapes that you can use as a starting point.

For example, here is how you can create a custom shape for an entity:

joint.shapes.devs.Entity = joint.shapes.devs.Model.extend({
    defaults: joint.util.deepSupplement({
        type: 'devs.Entity',
        size: { width: 80, height: 40 },
        attrs: {
            '.label': { text: 'Entity', 'font-size': 14 },
            rect: { stroke: '#7c68fc', 'stroke-width': 2 }
        }
    }, joint.shapes.devs.Model.prototype.defaults)
});

    You can then use these custom shapes to create and manipulate the entities and relationships in your diagram. For example, you can create a new entity and add it to the diagram like this:

var entity = new joint.shapes.devs.Entity();

graph.addCell(entity);

    To enable drag and drop functionality, you can use JointJS's drag and drop events. For example, you can listen for the drag event on the entity shape and update its position in the diagram as it is being dragged:

entity.on('drag', function() {
    paper.fitToContent({ padding: 20 });
});

This is just a simple example of how you can use JointJS to create an ER diagram editor. There are many more features and customization options available, and you can find more detailed documentation and examples on the JointJS website.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

Are there options for intelligent layout?

Yes, there are options for intelligent layout in JointJS and other diagramming libraries. An intelligent layout algorithm is a function that rearranges the elements in a diagram in a visually pleasing way, taking into account factors such as the size and position of the elements, the connections between them, and the overall structure of the diagram.

JointJS provides several built-in layout algorithms that you can use to automatically arrange the elements in your diagram. For example, the forceDirected layout uses a physics-based algorithm to arrange the elements in a way that reduces overlap and helps to balance the overall structure of the diagram.

You can use a layout algorithm like this by calling the layout function on the graph and passing in the desired layout algorithm as an option:

graph.layout({
    type: 'forceDirected',
    padding: 50,
    maxSimulationTime: 10000,
    animate: true
});

Other diagramming libraries, such as GoJS and CytoscapeJS, also provide built-in layout algorithms that you can use to automatically arrange the elements in your diagram.

It's also possible to create custom layout algorithms if the built-in options don't meet your specific needs. For example, you can use a graph theory library such as Graphviz to calculate custom layouts based on the structure of the graph.

At this point, i am mostly interested in jointJS, so limit your examples to that library.

var paper = new joint.dia.Paper({
    el: $('#diagram-container'),

    height: 300,
    gridSize: 1,
    model: graph
});

        attrs: {
            '.label': { text: 'Entity', 'font-size': 14 },
            rect: { stroke: '#7c68fc', 'stroke-width': 2 }
        }
    }, joint.shapes.devs.Model.prototype.defaults)
});

    You can then use these custom shapes to create and manipulate the entities and relationships in your diagram. For example, you can create a new entity and add it to the diagram like this:

var entity = new joint.shapes.devs.Entity();

graph.addCell(entity);

Can a layout be saved? Is there undo capabilities?

Yes, it is possible to save the layout of a JointJS diagram and restore it later, as well as to undo and redo layout changes.

To save the layout of a JointJS diagram, you can use the toJSON function to serialize the diagram's model and layout data into a JSON object. You can then store this JSON object in a database or file, and later load it back into the diagram using the fromJSON function.

Here is an example of how you can save the layout of a JointJS diagram:

// Serialize the diagram's model and layout data into a JSON object
var layoutData = graph.toJSON();

// Store the JSON object in a database or file

...

// Later, load the layout data back into the diagram
graph.fromJSON(layoutData);

To enable undo and redo functionality, you can use JointJS's commandManager module, which allows you to create and execute commands that modify the diagram's model and layout. You can then use the undo and redo functions to undo and redo these commands.

Here is an example of how you can use the commandManager module to enable undo and redo functionality:

var commandManager = new joint.dia.CommandManager({ graph: graph });

// Execute a command to add an entity to the diagram
commandManager.execute(new joint.shapes.devs.EntityCommand({
    position: { x: 100, y: 100 },
    size: { width: 80, height: 40 }
}));

// Undo the command
commandManager.undo();

// Redo the command
commandManager.redo();

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

That's the programmatic approach. What happens if a user drags a symbol on the screen. Does the framework automatically record those actions?

In JointJS, if you want to record user actions such as dragging a symbol on the screen as commands that can be undone and redone, you will need to use the commandManager module and create custom commands for these actions.

For example, you can listen for the change:position event on the symbol shape, which is triggered when the symbol is dragged, and create a custom command to update the symbol's position. You can then execute this command using the commandManager's execute function.

Here is an example of how you can do this:

// Create a custom command to update the position of a symbol
var MoveSymbolCommand = joint.dia.Command.extend({
    // The `execute` function is called when the command is executed
    execute: function() {
        this.model.set('position', this.position);
    },
    // The `undo` function is called when the command is undone
    undo: function() {
        this.model.set('position', this.previousPosition);
    },
    // The `redo` function is called when the command is redone
    redo: function() {
        this.execute();
    }
});

// Create a new command manager
var commandManager = new joint.dia.CommandManager({ graph: graph });

// Listen for the `change:position` event on the symbol shape
symbol.on('change:position', function() {
    // Create a new instance of the `MoveSymbolCommand`
    var command = new MoveSymbolCommand({
        model: symbol,
        position: symbol.get('position'),
        previousPosition: symbol.previous('position')
    });
    // Execute the command
    commandManager.execute(command);
});

This is just a simple example of how you can use the commandManager module to record user actions as commands that can be undone and redone. There are many more customization options available, and you can find more detailed documentation and examples on the JointJS website.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
